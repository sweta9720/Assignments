    "\n",
    "A: In a Python try-except statement, the else block is used to define a section of code that should be executed only if no exceptions were raised in the corresponding try block. In other words, if the try block runs successfully without any exceptions being raised, the code in the else block will be executed. If an exception occurs in the try block, the code in the else block will be skipped. Example: "

    "\n",
    "RuntimeError: A generic base class for various runtime errors.\n",

    "KeyboardInterrupt: Raised when the user interrupts the program's execution (usually by pressing Ctrl+C).\n",

    "\n",
    "A: Logging is a way to store information about your script and track events that occur. When writing any complex script in Python, logging is essential for debugging software as you develop it. Without logging, finding the source of a problem in your code may be extremely time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when\n",
    "each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Log levels relate to the “importance” of the log. For example, an “error” log is a top priority and should be considered more urgent than a “warn” log. A “debug” log is usually only useful when the application is being debugged. A \"info\" log is usually shown on confirmation that things are working as expected. A \"warning\" is shown as an indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected. A \"critical\" log is usually when a serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log\n",
    "message format using formatters?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Log formatters are used to define the layout and structure of log messages. They determine how the information is presented when a log entry is recorded, including the timestamp, log level, logger name, and the actual log message. The logging module provides a default formatter, but we can create our own custom formatters to tailor the log messages to your needs."
