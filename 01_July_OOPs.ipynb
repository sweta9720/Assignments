    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is base don classes and objects . It is used to structure a program into simple , reusable piece of code.It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a particular instance of a class. It can be thought of as a self-contained entity that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects are created from classes, which serve as blueprints or templates defining their structure and behavior. Every object has a unique identity and can interact with other objects by invoking their methods or accessing their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: A Class is an object constructor or a blueprint from which objects are created. It provides a means of bundling data and functionality together.Class in python are the user-defined blueprints that help us create an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: An attribute is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a class. A function stored in an instance or class is called a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Class variables are those variables that are defined within a class and before the class constructor i,e, __init__ method. Because class variables are shared by all instances of the class and owned by the class itself. Class variables are typically placed below the class name and outside of instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are declared inside the constructor method of the class i.e the __init__ method. Every object has its own value in an instance variable.Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. If there was no self argument, the same class couldn't hold the information for both these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For a library management system, you have to design the \"Book\" class with OOP\n",
    "principles in mind. The “Book” class will have following attributes:\n",
    "a. title: Represents the title of the book.\n",
    "b. author: Represents the author(s) of the book.\n",
    "c. isbn: Represents the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of the book.\n",
    "d. publication_year: Represents the year of publication of the book.\n",
    "e. available_copies: Represents the number of copies available for checkout.\n",
    "The class will also include the following methods:\n",
    "a. check_out(self): Decrements the available copies by one if there are copies\n",
    "available for checkout.\n",
    "b. return_book(self): Increments the available copies by one when a book is\n",
    "returned.\n",
    "c. display_book_info(self): Displays the information about the book, including its\n",
    "attributes and the number of available copies."
